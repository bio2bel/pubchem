PubChem to BEL
==============
This repository has multiple goals, most importantly: mapping between MeSH, PubChem, and standard chemical identifiers.
Currently, this information is scattered and incredibly difficult to access. First the following resources are
available:

- ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras/README-Extras
    - Map to MeSH with ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras/CID-MeSH
    - Map to Substance with ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras/CID-SID.gz
    - Map to InChI with ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras/CID-InChI-Key.gz
- ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pubchem/Substance/Extras/README-Extras
    - Map to MeSH with ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pubchem/Substance/Extras/SID-MeSH
    - Map to other databases with ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pubchem/Substance/Extras/SID-Map.gz
